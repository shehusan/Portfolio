            <h4>EKIRS Land Use Charge (LUC) Data Collection Project (Jan 2024 - May 2024)</h4>
            <p>Associated with Milsat</p>
            <p>The MILSAT/EKIRS LUC Data Collection project focused on cataloging property records and identifying key locations to enhance spatial data accuracy for Land Use Charge (LUC) assessments and urban planning. By addressing gaps in property databases, this initiative supports evidence-based decision-making for sustainable development.</p>
            <p>Key Insights:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Property Types: Predominantly completed buildings (68.52%) and uncompleted buildings (17.66%).</li>
                <li>Property Status: Mainly old-looking properties (42%) and new-looking properties (30.61%).</li>
                <li>Ownership: Largely private individual ownership (71.28%).</li>
                <li>Responsibility: Most properties have unknown in-charge persons (75.12%).</li>
                <li>Structures: Majority are bungalows (47.17%).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Impact: The project significantly improved property records for EKIRS, creating a comprehensive database that enhances revenue collection and supports informed urban planning. This successful execution highlights our commitment to leveraging data for sustainable development in Ekiti State.</p>
